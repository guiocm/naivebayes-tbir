Code created for the final assignment of the Text Based Information Retrieval
course at KULeuven.
Implements classifiers based on Multinomial Naive Bayes, for patent 
classification with the WIPO Alpha dataset.

Usage:
    
    python nb.py <levels> <training_file> <test_file> <verbose>

    levels 
        Specify the number of classifier levels - 1 or 2.
        With one level a single classifier is used (~81.7% accuracy).
        With two levels, one classifier is used for the main class, and
        8 classifiers are used within each main class (~79.7% accuracy).

    training_file
        File containing the training data.

    test_file
        File containing the test data.

    verbose
        Optional parameter that enables the output of the classification
        result for each test sample.

If no parameters are passed, the following is assumed:
    python nb.py 1 wipoalpha-train.txt wipoalpha-test.txt
